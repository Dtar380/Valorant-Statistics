# Valorant-Statistics

## What is this project about?

This project started as school project in which we where told to do some spreadsheets with
data we gathered about a certain topic, and I chose studying the Valorant player base,
because it's a game I play really often.<br>
The school project soon turned into a personal thing, and I started doing a web site to
allow people to access, use and play with the gathered data.<br>

## How does it work?

The data is gathered via a google form, which is filled in by the players themselves.
This may not be the best way to gather data, because it relies on the players honesty,
but it works for now.<br>
The data is then stored in a google spreadsheet, and the site uses a self made API with
python and FastAPI to display the data nicely on the web site, so that everyone can easily
access it.<br>

## How can I help?

There are many ways you can help and contribute to this project.<br>
You can contribute with the data gathering, just by filling in the google form you will
already be helping me,or you can live a donation on my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/dtar380)
